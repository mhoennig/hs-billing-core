Performance + Efficiency
- read billing items only on a per-customer basis
    e.g. by first generating a separate file for each customer from all billing item files

File-Formats
- decide if we want mandatory header lines in csv-files
- what's customer.fullName? can we drop it?
- do we need both "DE" as well es "Germany" for customer?
- which field values do we need to validate? e.g. email?
- check field names for "denglisch"
- configurable number formats (#,## vs. #.## etc.)
- output vat rate as 0,16 or 16,00?

Architecture
- refactor Billing, extracting the InvoiceGenerator to become just orchestrator

Code-Quality
- ktlint installieren
- increase mutationThreshold.set(85) to 95 for pitest
- configure path coverage for jacoco
