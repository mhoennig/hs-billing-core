Performance + Efficiency
- read billing items only on a per-customer basis
    e.g. by first generating a separate file for each customer from all billing item files

File-Formats
- decide if we want mandatory header lines in csv-files
- what's customer.fullName? can we drop it?
- do we need both "DE" as well es "Germany" for customer?
